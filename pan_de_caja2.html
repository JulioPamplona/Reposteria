        <br>
* 200 grams of flour + the necessary to knead
        <br>
* 1 tablespoon of salt

        <br>
* 1 spoon of sugar

        <br>
* 1 egg
        <br>

Preparation:
        <br>
        <br>
1. PLACE flour, salt and sugar in a bowl. Add the oil, the yeast, the milk and the egg. 
 <br>
2. MIX with a spatula and when the ingredients are well integrated, knead for 6 minutes on a clean surface. Let it rest in a warm place for an hour or until it doubles its volume.
 <br>
3. PUT the dough to remove the air that accumulates, stretch and fold the dough inward along and then across.
 <br>
Place in a rectangular mold and let stand for half an hour.
 <br>
4. BAKE at 180 Â° C for 25 minutes or until the bread is golden brown.
 <br>
5. Allow to cool completely and portion or reserve. Keep in a plastic bag so it does not dry out. 
 <br>
You can add sunflower seeds, linseed, aromatic herbs and the spices that you like the most to achieve a unique bread.
