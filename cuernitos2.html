  INGREDIENTS:
        <br>
        <br>
* ½ kilo of wheat flour
    <br>
* 10 grams of baking powder
    <br>
* 10 grams of sugar
    <br>
* 25 grams of milk powder
    <br>
* 100 ml of water
    <br>
* 3 eggs
    <br>
* 2 teaspoons of salt
    <br>
* 300 grams of butter or margarine
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        
        <br>
Preparation:
        <br>
        <br>
1. MIX in a bowl, wheat flour, yeast, sugar, milk powder, water, eggs and salt. When you begin to integrate all the ingredients, knead for 10 to 15 minutes or until the dough no longer sticks on your hands and becomes elastic.
<br>
2. FORM a square with the dough and let stand for 30 minutes. Flatten the butter or margarine and form a square (maximum 1 cm thick). Stretch the dough to a square wider than butter. 
<br>
3. PLACE the butter on the dough, cover the butter with the dough and begin to stretch along. Fold as if it were a triptych, retrace and bend 3 more times. Let rest for 30 more minutes
<br>
4. Stretch the dough again and cut it lengthwise; you must obtain 10 cm wide strips. Make diagonal cuts to obtain triangles. Stretch the dough gently and roll the triangles from the widest part to the narrowest, to get the shape of the little horn.
<br>
Leave them like this to obtain croissants or lower the tips for the little horns. 
<br>
5. VARNISH with a beaten egg with a tablespoon of milk and bake at 180ºC for 10 to 15 minutes until golden brown.
