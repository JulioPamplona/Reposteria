    <br>
* 1 NESTLÉ® Half Cream Can
    <br>
* 1 Pineapple Gelatin Pack (35 g)
    <br>
* 1 Package Gelatin lemon (35 g)

Preparation:
        <br>
        <br>
1. Prepare the flavor gelatins one by one with two less cups of hot water than the package indicates. Pour them separately into rectangular molds and refrigerate to set. Remove from the refrigerator and cut into cubes; combine them and place them in a slightly greased jelly mold.
 <br>
2. Blend LA LECHERA® Condensed Milk with CARNATION® CLAVEL® Evaporated Milk, NESTLÉ® Half Cream and vanilla essence; With the lit blender, add, little by little, the previously dissolved grenetine.
 <br>
3. Pour the previous preparation into the mold with the pictures of the flavored gelatins and refrigerate until set; desmolda and offers.
 <br>
   You can grease the mold with a little oil so that the gelatin is easily demolded.
